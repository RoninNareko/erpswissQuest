## Introduction

This project utilizes the Fake Store API to provide e-commerce data. The design is inspired by [Odoo's online shop](https://www.odoo.com/ru_RU/shop). To ensure the API functions correctly without any errors, follow the steps below:

## Getting Started

1. Clone or download this repository to your local machine.

2. Open the `index.html` file.

3. Run `index.html` on a local server. We recommend using a tool like "Live Server" in Visual Studio Code, or any other local server of your choice.

4. Access the `index.html` page using either the HTTP or HTTPS protocol. This is essential to prevent Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) policy errors. Using other protocols may result in an error like this:

```plaintext
Access to script at '/erpswissQuest-main/js/main.js' from origin 'null' has been blocked by CORS policy: Cross-origin requests are only supported for protocol schemes: http, data, isolated-app, chrome-extension, chrome, https, chrome-untrusted.
